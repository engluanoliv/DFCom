# üõí Product Review App ‚Äì Full Stack Challenge

This project was developed as part of the **DFcom Sistemas Technical Challenge**.  
It provides a full stack application for **managing products** and their **reviews**.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** + **Express**
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose**
- REST API with CRUD endpoints for **Products** and **Reviews**
- Aggregation pipeline to calculate the **average rating** of a product

### Frontend
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- **Vite** (chosen for simplicity and speed in this challenge)
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication
- Componentized interface for products and reviews management

> üí° Note: I chose **Vite** for the frontend since the challenge requires React with Hooks.  
In a real-world SaaS application, I could also use **Next.js** to handle SSR/SEO and API routes in the same codebase.

### Bonus
- **Docker Compose** setup with:
  - MongoDB
  - Backend
  - Frontend
